# ICEDynamicsPrediction
A Numerical Study on optimum prediction algorithm for performance of internal combustionÂ engine using various Correlation algorithms.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine and run the correlation algorithms.

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ICEDYNAMICS.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd ICEDYNAMICS


3. Install the required Python packages:

pip install pandas scikit-learn


3. Run the python Script

python correation_algorithms.py



## Usage

**Step 1: Data Preparation**

Place your training data in a CSV file named `Train_data.csv` within the project directory.

**Step 2: Running the Algorithms**

1. Open a Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python IDE.
2. Open and run the `correlation_algorithms.py` notebook. This notebook contains code to apply different regression algorithms on the dataset and generate algebraic equations for the target variables.

## Algorithms

### Linear Regression

Uses the `LinearRegression` class from scikit-learn to perform linear regression.

### Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Utilizes the `SVR` class from scikit-learn with a linear kernel for support vector regression.

### Bayesian Ridge Regression

Implements the Bayesian Ridge Regression algorithm using the `BayesianRidge` class.

### Lasso Regression

Applies Lasso Regression using the `Lasso` class.

## Results

The algebraic equations generated by each regression algorithm for the target variables are displayed in the notebook's output.
