A Numerical Study on optimum prediction algorithm for performance of internal combustionÂ engine using various Correlation algorithms.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine and run the correlation algorithms.

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ICEDYNAMICS.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd ICEDYNAMICS


3. Install the required Python packages:

bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn


3. Run the python Script

bash
python correation_algorithms.py


### Usage

1. Place your training data in a CSV file named `Train_data.csv` within the project directory.

2. Open a Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python IDE.

3. Open and run the `correlation_algorithms.py ` notebook. This notebook contains code to apply different regression algorithms on the dataset and generate algebraic equations for the target variables._

### Algorithms
